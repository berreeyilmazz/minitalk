You must create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.
• The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.
• The client takes two parameters:
◦ The server PID.
◦ The string to send.
• The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.
Once the string has been received, the server must print it.
• The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think
it takes too long, then it is probably too long.
